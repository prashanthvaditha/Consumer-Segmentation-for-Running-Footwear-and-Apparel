# Consumer Segmentation for Running Footwear and Apparel

## Project Overview

This project aims to identify distinct consumer segments for a running footwear and apparel company using clustering analysis on survey data. The segmentation helps to uncover actionable insights for tailored product offerings and targeted marketing strategies.

The analysis employs **hierarchical clustering** and **K-means clustering**, and includes the following steps:
1. **Data Exploration and Preparation**: Cleaning and transforming the dataset for clustering.
2. **Similarity Metrics Calculation**: Calculating relevant distance measures.
3. **Cluster Determination**: Using the Elbow method to identify the optimal number of clusters.
4. **Clustering Implementation**: Conducting hierarchical and K-means clustering.
5. **Cluster Profiling**: Analyzing cluster characteristics to derive actionable insights.

## File Descriptions

### 1. Notebook File: `Consumer Segmentation for Running Footwear and Apparel Notebook.ipynb`
This Jupyter Notebook contains the full analysis pipeline:
- Data exploration, cleaning, and preparation.
- Implementation of hierarchical and K-means clustering algorithms.
- Determination of the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method.
- Profiling and interpretation of the identified consumer segments.

### 2. Dataset: `survey_data.xlsx`
This Excel file includes the raw survey data used for clustering analysis. It contains consumer responses related to preferences, demographics, and purchasing behaviors relevant to running footwear and apparel.
